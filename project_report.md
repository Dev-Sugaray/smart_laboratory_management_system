# Project Report

## 1. Introduction

This report details the work undertaken for the project. The primary objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) designed to manage and track laboratory data and workflows efficiently. This involved the design and implementation of both backend and frontend components to support core laboratory operations, including sample management, experiment and test tracking, instrument logging, basic inventory control, and user management with role-based access control. The scope of this project encompasses user authentication and authorization, tracking the lifecycle of samples, defining and managing experiments and tests, logging instrument usage, and maintaining a basic inventory of reagents and supplies. Advanced features such as automated reporting, direct integration with laboratory instruments, complex statistical analysis modules, and billing functionalities were considered out of scope for this phase of development. This document will cover the methodology, design, implementation, results, and conclusions drawn from this work.

## 2. Methodology

The methodology adopted for this project involved several key phases. Initially, the project focused on defining the core requirements, evidenced by the detailed API and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) documentation. This was followed by the design of the database schema (utilizing SQLite) and the overall application architecture. This was followed by the parallel development of the backend API using Node.js with Express.js and the frontend user interface using Vue.js with Vite. The subsequent phase focused on the iterative implementation of distinct modules, including sample management, instrument tracking, experiment and test definition, and inventory control, building out both backend routes and frontend components for each. Finally, the project involved unit testing for both backend (Jest) and frontend (Vitest) components to ensure functionality and the preparation of key documentation (API_DOCUMENTATION.md, RBAC_DOCUMENTATION.md). Specific techniques utilized include a full-stack JavaScript development approach, RESTful API design principles for backend services, component-based architecture for the Vue.js frontend, and version control managed via Git. The backend employs JWT for stateless authentication and bcrypt for password hashing. This systematic approach ensured that all objectives were addressed in a structured manner.

## 3. Design and Implementation

### 3.1 Design

The design phase focused on The system is designed with a monolithic backend service built with Node.js and Express, and a separate single-page application (SPA) frontend developed using Vue.js. Key design decisions included:
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express.js for the backend, chosen for its lightweight nature and suitability for I/O-bound operations, along with the JavaScript ecosystem alignment. SQLite was selected as the database for its simplicity and file-based storage, suitable for small to medium-scale applications. Vue.js (version 3) with Vite was chosen for the frontend due to its modern reactive capabilities, component-based architecture, and efficient development tooling.
- **Database Schema**: A relational database schema was designed, as detailed in `backend/init-db.js`, featuring tables for users, roles, permissions, samples, sample types, sources, storage locations, chain of custody, instruments, instrument usage logs, experiments, tests (definitions), experiment-test associations, sample tests (runs), reagents, suppliers, and reagent orders. This structure aims to normalize data and support the required application functionalities.
- **API Design**: A RESTful API was implemented to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, with endpoints documented in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`. Authentication is handled via JWTs, and authorization is managed through a role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- **UI/UX Considerations**: The frontend is structured with reusable Vue components and uses Vue Router for navigation and Pinia for state management. Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling, suggesting an approach towards responsive and utility-first design. Detailed schema relationships can be inferred from `backend/init-db.js` and API interactions from `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`. The design aimed to achieve modularity, evident in the separation of backend routes and frontend components, maintainability through clear code structure and documentation, and user-friendliness for laboratory personnel by providing a clear interface for managing complex workflows.

### 3.2 Implementation

The implementation was carried out using The backend was implemented using Node.js and Express.js, with SQLite for the database. Frontend development utilized JavaScript with Vue.js 3, Vite as the build tool, Pinia for state management, and Vue Router for navigation. Development tools included Nodemon for backend auto-reloading and concurrently for managing multiple development processes. Testing frameworks employed were Jest for the backend and Vitest for the frontend. The core components developed include:
- **Backend**: A comprehensive set of RESTful API endpoints for managing users (registration, login, profile), samples (registration, status updates, lifecycle tracking), instruments (registration, usage logging), experiments (creation, test association), test definitions, sample test runs (requesting, result entry), and inventory (reagents, suppliers, orders). This also includes robust authentication (JWT, bcrypt) and authorization (RBAC) middleware.
- **Frontend**: A user interface with views for login, registration, user profiles, sample management (dashboard, registration, detail view, type/source/storage management), instrument management (listing, detail view, usage logging), experiment management (listing, creation, detail view), test definition management (listing, creation, detail view), and a test queue for sample test runs. Reusable components were created for forms, lists, and navigation, and Pinia stores manage application state for various modules. Significant hurdles included designing a comprehensive and normalized database schema to capture all necessary lab data relationships, implementing a secure and flexible role-based access control system, and managing application state effectively across the various frontend components. These were addressed through careful planning of the database structure, detailed definition of roles and permissions, and leveraging Pinia for centralized state management in the Vue.js application.

### 3.3 Results

The project yielded the following key results:
- Successful development of a functional Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) providing core features for managing samples, experiments, instruments, and basic inventory.
- Implementation of a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system, detailed in `RBAC_DOCUMENTATION.md`, ensuring data security and appropriate access levels for different user roles (administrator, lab_manager, researcher).
- Creation of a modular, component-based frontend with dedicated views for various laboratory workflows, facilitating user interaction and data entry.
The system supports a wide range of API endpoints (detailed in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`) for comprehensive data manipulation and retrieval. The presence of unit tests for both backend and frontend components (though coverage metrics are not provided) indicates a commitment to code quality and reliability.

## 4. Conclusion

This project successfully delivered a functional Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) capable of handling key laboratory data management tasks, including sample tracking, experiment management, instrument logging, and basic inventory control, thereby meeting its primary objectives. The work demonstrated that the chosen technology stack (Node.js/Express for backend, Vue.js for frontend, SQLite for database) is effective for developing a comprehensive web-based LIMS. The modular design of both backend and frontend components allows for good separation of concerns and potential for future expansion. The chosen methodology, involving initial requirements definition and schema design followed by iterative development of backend and frontend modules, proved to be effective in creating a well-structured and functional application. The presence of API and RBAC documentation from an early stage facilitated a clear development path.
